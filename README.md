_printf():
Description : 


This repository contains the complete code required for our custom function called `_printf()`, developed by Mohammed Ayoub Essbai and Zineb Zid. This function is a condensed version of the `printf()` function from the C language's `stdio.h` library. Our `_printf()` aims to mimic the precise functionality of the standard C function `printf()`. This project was undertaken as part of our software engineering program's curriculum.

C language standard functions used : 
malloc, free, , va_start, va_end, va_copy, va_arg 


Brief Synopsis:


The `_printf()` function is designed to accept two parameters: a character pointer named 'format' that points to a string and a 'variable arguments list' referred to as 'arg_list'. Within the `_printf()` function, it iterates through the 'format' string, scanning for conversion specifiers, which are identified by the presence of the '%' symbol.


Usage 

The directory contents should be compiled with the following command:

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
_printf() function may be used, in any C language program. This is the prototype:
_printf(const char *[FORMAT], ...)


Tasks : 
Task 0  :  I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life : is asking to write a function that produces output according to a format . 
Task 1 : Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't : is asking to handle the following custom conversion specifier .
